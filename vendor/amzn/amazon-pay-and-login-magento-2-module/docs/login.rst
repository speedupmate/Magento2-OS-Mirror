Login with Amazon
=================
**Login with Amazon** allows users to login to your shop using their Amazon username and password. The name, email address and user id is fetched from Amazon in order to facilitate the creation of a Magento account. Shipping and billing address will be retrieved as part of the checkout.

Customers who have logged in via Login with Amazon previously, will be recognized and automatically logged in into the Magento customer account as well. In case an account for the email address already exists, the accounts can be linked to add **Login with Amazon** as another option to sign in for the customer.

Requirements
------------
To offer the **Login with Amazon** service, you have to have a valid **Amazon Payments** merchant account (refer to the :ref:`prerequisites-amazon-account-setup` if you don't have one yet), registered application for **Login with Amazon** service (refer to the :ref:`prerequisites-registering-application-for-login-with-amazon` if you don't have one yet) and Magento 2 store with a valid SSL certificate installed and properly configured in your shop.
